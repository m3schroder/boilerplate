## Node Server

## Intro
<p>This application serves as a program interface for a hosted MYSQL server.</p>

## Key objectives 
  <ul>
    <li>Basic CRUD operations</li>
    <li>User authentication</li>
    <li>Caching / sessions</li>
    <li>Protect endpoints</li> 
  </ul>
  
## Additional goals
  <ul>
  <li> Create secure payment system </li>
  </ul>
  
  
## Methods
I'll work on MVPs for each of the objectives in the order they are listed and then loop back to improve on each objective
afterwards. I will start by creating basic CRUD operations for a single users table, then protecting the routes used in those operations
and keep with that pattern for each of the other objectives. Once I'm through with the first iteration I will go back to build out,
optimize, and refactor.
